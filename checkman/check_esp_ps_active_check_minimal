description:
 This active check monitors a specified service's state based on provided parameters.

 It prints the service name along with its state and sets an appropriate exit code based on the state.

 The check does not rely on Checkmk agents but instead runs as an active check.

Monitored Aspects:

 Takes in a state parameter (OK, WARN, CRIT, UNK).

 Accepts a servicename parameter to label the monitored service.

 Outputs a formatted string containing the service name and its status.

 Returns the corresponding exit codes:

 OK (0), WARN (1), CRIT (2), UNK (3).

Conditions for State:

 The state must be provided as one of the expected values (OK, WARN, CRIT, UNK).

 If parameters are missing, default values are used.

Prerequisites:

 No additional agent plug-ins are required.

 Ensure the script is executable and accessible in the configured monitoring environment.

item:
 Not applicable (this check does not use an item).

inventory:
 The check does not perform automatic service discovery. It must be manually added as an active check within Checkmk.

usage:
 This check can be used by adding it as a custom active check in Checkmk and passing the appropriate parameters.

discovery:
 One service is created for each project id in cost data.
